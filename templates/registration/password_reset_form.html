<!-- templates/registration/password_reset_form.html 

    The default template for password reset is located at 
    templates/registration/password_reset_form.html. 
    We can customize it by creating our own password_reset_form.html file:

-->
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}Forgot Your Password?{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>Forgot your password?</h1>
  <p>Enter your email address below, and we'll email instructions for setting a new one.</p>

  <form method="POST">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <input type="submit" value="Send me instructions!">
  </form>
{% endblock %}
